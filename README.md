# Shape Clicky-Game

### Overview

This is a React.js based memory game. The game is broken up into UI components, with one stateful component passing the managed state to non-stateful components.

### How the Game Works

* This is a memory game. The object is to click a shape to earn points but not click the same shape twice.

* When a user clicks on a shape, all images shuffle and a point is given.

* If a user clicks on the same shape, the game ends and the game resets.

* The high score is retained and the user clicks on a new shape to start the game again.

### Technologies Used

* ES6
* CSS
* JavaScript
* React
